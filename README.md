# Optimizing Auction Strategies Using Game Theory

This repository contains the implementation and experimental results of a bot designed for optimizing auction-based collection games using advanced bidding strategies. The project leverages game theory, auction theory, and machine learning techniques to enhance performance in competitive auction scenarios.

**Overview**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a smart bot capable of dynamically adjusting its bidding strategies to maximize success in collection-based auction games. By incorporating painting importance, opponent behavior analysis, and game progression dynamics, the bot demonstrates competitive performance and resource efficiency.

**Key Features**

**Dynamic Bidding Strategy:** Adapts bids based on the importance of items, opponent behavior, and game phases.
**Opponent Analysis:** Evaluates average bids, budget estimates, and bidding patterns to anticipate and counter competitor actions.
**Game Stage Awareness:** Adjusts strategies dynamically between early and late game phases for optimal resource utilization.
**Compatibility:** Supports multiple auction types, including first-price and second-price auctions.
Technologies Used

**Programming Language:** Python
**Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
**Game Theory Frameworks:** Inspired by Nash equilibrium and optimization theories
**Simulation Environment:** Custom-designed auction simulation platform for testing and evaluation

How It Works

Bidding Strategy:
The bot identifies key items required for completing collections.
Dynamically adjusts bids based on opponent analysis and available budget.
Optimizes late-game strategies to secure essential items.
Opponent Analysis:
Evaluates competitor behaviors to anticipate bidding trends.
Monitors budget levels to adjust strategies accordingly.
Results

Win Rate: The bot achieved an average win rate of 90% in simulated games.
Efficiency: Demonstrated superior budget utilization compared to baseline strategies.
Scalability: Adaptable to various auction types and dynamic game conditions.

**Future Enhancements**

Extend support for additional auction formats.
Integrate reinforcement learning for adaptive bidding strategies.
Expand testing to include a broader range of opponents and game configurations.
